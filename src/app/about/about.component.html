            <h3>How We Started</h3>
            <span>
                It all started with a vacation, a car, and a random name slapped on the back. 
                Seeing that got me thinking—what if there was a better way to "review" someone's 
                driving? Not just a phone number you’ll never call, but something quick, digital, 
                and (most importantly) kind of ridiculous. Thus, Review My Driving was born. 
                But I didn’t just want to make another boring feedback form—I wanted something 
                that actively fought back. A website with a mind of its own. One that makes you 
                work for every keystroke and second-guess every checkbox.

            <h3>Our Background</h3>
            <span>
                I’ve been a software engineer my whole life—seriously, 
                this is what I was meant to do. From a young age, I knew I wanted to 
                build things, and this project lets me combine that passion with a little 
                creative chaos. There’s something truly exciting about taking a simple 
                concept and turning it into an experience—one that’s equal parts frustrating 
                and hilarious.

            <h3>What We Do</h3>
            <span>
                At the end of the day, we all have thoughts about the way people drive, but 
                there hasn’t really been a good way to share them—until now. Calling a number 
                on the back of a truck? Not happening. But scanning a QR code and 
                submitting a review? Much better. Review My Driving makes it easier 
                (and slightly more entertaining) to give and get feedback. 
                Whether you're here to rant, reflect, or just experience the worst 
                form UI imaginable, welcome aboard.
